## Going forward...

## Near Future
#  Fix the percentage display on the Game Over Screen
#  Make the colors change over time; a evening to dark night cycle to dawn?

## Far Future    
#  Add 3 difficulties
#  Add down as a break
#  When holding break you can drift
#  Space bar to excel -- if not you go very slow but must keep going
#  Add a new calculation for the coins and your speed,
#  but also make them appear less often as slower speeds
